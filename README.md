# PKAN: $\psi$ - Kolmogorov Arnold Networks

## Brief Description

**PKAN** is a ab-initio model to predict electronic ground states energies by approximating electron wavefunctions with Kolmogorov Arnold Networks.

This is the github repo for the paper ['PKAN: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks for Ab-initio Quantum Chemistry'](https://todo.com), which is the computational chemistry extension of the methods developed in ["KAN 2.0: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Meet Science"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10205).
<!--The general network structure for predicting ground state energies is illustrated below. ADD FIGURE OF NETWORK - TIKS

Examples can be seen in the [examples](./examples/) folder and all functions/classes have been documented within the source code. We describe some of the basic functionality here:

Currently this repo contains proof-of-concept for learning 1-D functions on simulation data. Moving forward the notebooks will be formalized into a proper library for ab-initio prediction.
